## Setup
```
$ npm install
```

## Commands

###### linter
- $ `npm run lint` Lint js and scss files

###### webpack dev servers
- $ `npm start` Start local server at http://localhost:4001
- $ `npm run start:test` Start local server with mocked gateway calls

###### end to end Protractor tests
- $ `npm run test:e2e` Run protractor tests

###### Karma unit tests
- $ `npm run test:unit` Run karma tests continuously (development mode)
- $ `npm run test:unit:single-run` Run karma tests once

###### linter & test suite
- $ `npm run test` Lint js and scss files, run karama test suite once, run end to end test suite once

###### build / package application
- $ `npm run build` Production Build /dist directory
- $ `npm run build:bamboo` Build process for Bamboo:
  - `npm install` will install all third party library dependencies
  - `npm run test` (see above)
  - `npm run build` (see above)

    *NOTE: before running build:bamboo, run killall node to kill any remaining node processes*

## RL SSO Module
Located in `/src/app/common/rl-sso` this module will handle the authentication with ReachLocal services. It listens for 401 responses and will open an authentication modal when needed.

## Translations
*Text used in the app should come from the appropriate lang-xx.js file.  Text should not be hard coded into html, javascript or css.*

See [Angular Translate](https://angular-translate.github.io/) for more information. Translation are configured and ran from `/src/app/root.module.js`
#### Additional Languages
Additional languages should be added to root module. Add the new language translation to the provider. *ie* `.translations('xx', xx)`.

This will also require the additional language objects be imported in the root modules as well. See `/src/app/lang-en.js` for an example of how to construct a translation object.
#### Language Select
`rl-language-select` component can be added to any view to switch between languages. It is recommended to place it in the sidebar or footer. The component will set a cookie to remember a users language preference.

## Unit Testing
Unit test are written in Jasmine and run by Karma. The test files (`*.spec.js`) should be placed in the same directory as the file it is intended to test.  

## [End to End Testing (e2e)](https://github.com/reachlocal/search-campaigns-client/blob/master/test/README.md)
E2e tests are also written in Jasmine but run by protractor. See the [e2e readme](https://github.com/reachlocal/search-campaigns-client/blob/master/test/README.md) for more details.

## Design Style guide
Use styles/variables.   See [ReachUI](https://reachlocal.github.io/style-guide/)
